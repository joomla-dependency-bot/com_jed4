The tables consist of:

Ticket Categories (Unknown, Extension, Review, Joomla Site Issue, New Listing Support, Current Listing Support, Site Technical Issues, Unpublished Support, Reported Review, Reported Extension, Vulnerable Item Report, VEL Developer Update, VEL Abandonware Report).

Ticket Linked Items (A table of models so that a ticket can have an Abandonware report linked and displayed within the ticket. Currently includes Extension, Review, Vulnerable Item Initial Report, Vulnerable Item Developer Update, VEL Abandonware Report).
